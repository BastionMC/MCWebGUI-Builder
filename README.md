<p align="center"><strong>The build tool for adding new content to MCWebGUI.</strong></p>

MCWebGUI's images have to be ordered in a very specific way, and it is just painful to add new content to it. So we made this tool to easily compile readable images into their necessary formats, this will also compile a lot of other stuff, such as CSS and JavaScript files. It also allows for new content to be added easily using XML configuration files. This tool's documentation is going to be delayed, so you either wait, or figure it our yourself. Sorry about that.
